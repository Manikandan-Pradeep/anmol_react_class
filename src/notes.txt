componentDidMount() -> Real DOM got the component JSX

// Updating Phase
static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) -> Update state based on props (does not trigger an updating phase eventhough state is changed). Should return an object which replaces your state

getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) -> Get called when your component before JSX updates goes from virtual DOM to real DOM. Return an any object which will be supplied to componentDidUpdate()
render() -> Rendering(i.e, virtual DOM updates are going to real DOM). Returns JSX
componentDidUpdate(props, state, snapshot) -> Gets called once the virtual DOM updates gets placed into the real DOM
